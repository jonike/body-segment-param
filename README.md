Repository of body segment parameter models.

## Proportionality models

* `data/dempster.csv`:
  The original data can be interpreted in various ways; here, I've omitted entries "Trunk minus shoulders" and "Trunk minus limbs" with the assumption that "Shoulders+Thorax+AbdoPelvis" is good enough (there's around 0.9% difference from doing so).
  Data from Dempster's original report.

* `data/harless.csv`:
  Taken from Zatz's book.
