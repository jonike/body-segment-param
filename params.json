{"name":"Body-segment-param","tagline":"Repository of body segment parameter models","body":"This repository contains the raw data for a multitude of body segment parameter models.\r\nCollecting this data, especially in standard form, is a tedious process; we hope that by making this data more widely available, biomechanics researchers (&c.) will be able able to concentrate more on biomechanics rather than copying tables of numbers.\r\nWe also hope that by making a rich set of data available, questions will arise regarding accuracy, scope, and coverage of the models, and that researchers will be more able to chose the appropriate model for their particular application.\r\n\r\nThis project is quite incomplete! The data added to date has been largely to support our own work. Contributions welcome of course; see the main Github repository and make a pull request.\r\n\r\nModels are divided into multiple folders and are described briefly in the main repository README. Please consult the original publication for each model for further information.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
